Power BI dashboard analyzing Data Professional Survey

📊 Data Professional Survey Breakdown – Power BI Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built from a dataset of 630 data professionals.
The goal of this analysis was to understand trends in job titles, salary ranges, countries of survey takers, favorite programming languages, and levels of happiness within the data profession.

The project includes data cleaning, data modeling, DAX measures, and a full visual storytelling dashboard.

🛠 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning

Before building visuals, the dataset went through a complete cleaning process:

Removing blanks & irrelevant entries

Formatting numeric fields (salary, age, happiness scores)

Standardizing categorical values (job titles, countries, programming languages)

Fixing typos & inconsistent text

Converting columns to proper data types

The cleaned dataset allowed for accurate calculations and better-quality visuals.

2. DAX Measures Created

Several calculated measures were created using DAX for deeper analysis:

Count of Survey Takers

Average of Survey Taker Age

Average Salary by Job Title

Happiness with Salary (score)

Happiness with Work/Life Balance (score)

Difficulty to Break Into Data

These measures help make the dashboard dynamic and insightful.
